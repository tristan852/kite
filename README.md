Kite is a high-performance Connect Four solver capable of evaluating any valid board position within practical time bounds, even on modest hardware. It is suitable for building AI bots, integrating into GUI applications, or analyzing positions programmatically.

Internally, Kite leverages **bitboards**, **alpha-beta pruning**, **position hashing**, **symmetry reduction**, and **opening book lookups** to provide fast and accurate game tree evaluation.

## ðŸš€ Features

* **Bitboard Representation**: Game states use 64-bit integers for fast updates and operations.
* **Symmetry Pruning**: Mirrored game states are considered equivalent and cached accordingly.
* **Alpha-Beta Pruning**: Reduces search space by skipping suboptimal branches early.
* **Move Ordering**: Uses heuristics that favor center columns and winning threats.
* **Transposition Caching**: Hashes each position and stores scores in an efficient score cache.
* **Opening Book**: Stores lots of precomputed scores for early-game positions.
* *and much more...*

## ðŸ“¦ Installation

Kite is available via **Maven Central** and can be easily added to any **Gradle** or **Maven** project.

### Gradle (Kotlin DSL)

Add the following code snippet to your `build.gradle.kts` file:

```kotlin
repositories {
    mavenCentral()
}

dependencies {
    implementation("io.github.tristan852:kite:1.0.3")
}
```

### Gradle (Groovy DSL)

Add the following code snippet to your `build.gradle` file:

```groovy
repositories {
    mavenCentral()
}

dependencies {
    implementation 'io.github.tristan852:kite:1.0.3'
}
```

### Maven

Add the following code snippet to your `pom.xml` file:

```xml

## ðŸš€ Getting Started

The Kite solver can be used by obtaining a reference to the singleton solver instance.
Note that the solver cannot be used by multiple threads in parallel.
The first time a reference to the Kite solver is obtained the solver is created and initialized first which may take a bit of time.

The following code snippet demonstrates how the Kite solver should ideally be used:

```java
// obtain access to the Kite solver
Kite kite = Kite.instance();

// if we haven't used the solver before
// then the board is still empty and it
// is red's turn

// red plays in the 4th column
// and yellow plays in the 6th column
kite.playMoves(4, 6);

// it is now red's turn, and they are going
// to win with their second to last stone
System.out.println(kite.evaluateBoard()); // = 2

// red plays in the 5th column
kite.playMove(5);

// it is now yellow's turn

// if yellow plays in the 6th column they
// are going to win with their last stone
System.out.println(kite.evaluateMove(6)); // = 1

// print a string representation
// of the current game state

// .......
// .......
// .......
// .......
// .......
// ...XXO.
// 
// moves: 465
System.out.println(kite.boardString());

// clear the board (i.e. go back to
// the starting game state)
kite.clearBoard();
```

## ðŸ§  Evaluation Scale

Kite uses the following score metric to represent the value of a board or a move under perfect play:

| Score   | Meaning                                             |
|---------|-----------------------------------------------------|
| `0`     | Draw                                                |
| `n > 0` | We win by playing our `n`th to last stone           |
| `n < 0` | Opponent wins by playing their `-n`th to last stone |

For example a score of `1` represents that we are going to win but only with our very last stone.
A score of `-2` means that our opponent will win with one stone to spare.
